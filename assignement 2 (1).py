#Q2
'''Variable is a container through which we assign values like-integer,float,string,boolean,complex
   
   To declare and assign variables we take a value or name and use "=" opreator 
   example-
   variable = value '''

a = 19     #so here we use a variables and we assign a value as 19

b = "yash" #so here we use b variables and we assign a value as "yash"

#Q3
# For converting one data type to another we used to take a variable suppose 

num = 59

# And we have to convert it into floating value. so used to write a code -

print(float(num))

# Similarly, we use can also do this with other data types.

# For complex number in python we used write a code

complex_num = 5+8j

print(complex_num)
